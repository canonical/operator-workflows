    description: |
      The ingress class to target for this ingress resource.

      If your cluster has multiple ingress controllers, this allows
      you to select the correct one, by setting the ingressClassName
      field on the ingress resource created by the charm.

      This value isn't available to be set via the relation as it's a
      property of the cluster's configuration.

      If this value is empty, the charm will use whichever ingress class has the
      "ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class" annotation set to "true".

      If multiple ingress classes are so configured, no selection will be made.
