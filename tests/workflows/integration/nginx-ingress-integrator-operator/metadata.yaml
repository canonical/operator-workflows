  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators) deploying and managing external access to HTTP/HTTPS services in a
  Kubernetes cluster via an Nginx Ingress resource. This requires the Kubernetes
  cluster in question to have an [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/) already deployed into it.

  This charm simplifies exposing services running inside a Kubernetes cluster to
  external clients. It offers TLS termination as well as easy configuration of a
  number of advanced features including rate limiting, restricting access to
  specific client IP source ranges, and OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS).

  As such, the charm makes it easy for charm developers to provide external
  access to their HTTP workloads in Kubernetes by easy integration offered via
  [the charm's nginx_route library](https://charmhub.io/nginx-ingress-integrator/libraries/nginx_route).

  For DevOps and SRE teams, providing ingress for charms that support a relation
  to this charm will be possible via a simple `juju relate` command.
summary: An operator to configure a kubernetes ingress.
