# operator-workflows

This repository includes several parametrized CI workflows to be used for both kubernetes and machine charms.

To use the workflows in your repository, just reuse them including the `secrets: inherit` key. Examples of usage for every workflow can be found at the [indico operator](https://github.com/canonical/indico-operator/blob/main/.github/workflows). Note that you will need a CHARMHUB_TOKEN among your repository secrets to be able to run the workflows that interact with charmhub.

## Workflows

### Test Workflow (`canonical/operator-workflows/.github/workflows/test.yaml@main`)
This workflow executes the default tox targets defined in the `tox.ini` file and generates a plain text report. This requires the `lint`, `unit`, `static` and `coverage-report` `tox` environments to be included in the tox defaults. See [the workflow file](.github/workflows/test.yaml) for workflow inputs.

### Comment Workflow (`canonical/operator-workflows/.github/workflows/comment.yaml@main`)
Posts the content of the artifact specified as a comment in a PR. It needs to be triggered from a PR triggered workflow.

### Integration Test Workflow (`canonical/operator-workflows/.github/workflows/integration_test.yaml@main`)
Builds the existing docker or rock images, if any, and executes the `integration` test target defined in the `tox.ini` file. The tox environment used can be changed with the `test-tox-env` input. See [the workflow file](.github/workflows/integration_test.yaml) for workflow inputs.

More information about OWASP ZAP testing can be found [here](OWASPZAP.md).

The following secrets are available for this workflow:

| Name | Description |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| INTEGRATION_TEST_ARGS | Additional arguments to pass to the integration test execution that contain secrets |

Furthermore, in order to export sensitive data as environment variables into the integration test run,
a mapping of variables to secrets can be defined by setting the [GitHub Action Variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables)
`INTEGRATION_TEST_SECRET_ENV_NAME` with the name of the environment variable you want to export and `INTEGRATION_TEST_SECRET_ENV_VALUE` with the value you want the environment variable to have.
 There are six slots available. In addition to the one mentioned above, you can use
`INTEGRATION_TEST_SECRET_ENV_NAME_{1,...5}` and `INTEGRATION_TEST_SECRET_ENV_VALUE_{1,...5}`.

When running the integration tests, the following posargs will be automatically passed to the `integration` target:

* --charm-file [charm_file_name]: The name of the charm artifact generated prior to the integration tests run, this argument can be supplied multiple times for charm with multiple bases.
* --{image-name}-image: The name of the image artifact built prior to the integration tests run, this argument may be supplied multiple times or not at all depending on the plan
* --{resource-name}-resource: The name of the charm file resources built prior to the integration tests run, this argument may be supplied multiple times or not at all depending on the plan
* --series [series]: As defined in the `series` configuration described option above
* -k [module]: As defined in the `modules` configuration option described above
* --keep-models
* --model testing: Only for tests running on a microk8s substrate
* One parameter per resource defined in the `metadata.yaml` of the charm, containing a reference to the built image

For instance, for pytest you can leverage this by adding a conftest.py file

```python
def pytest_addoption(parser):
    """Add test arguments."""
    parser.addoption("--charm-file", action="append")
```

and then use the argument value

```python
charm = pytestconfig.getoption("--charm-file")[0] # the charm only has one base
```

tmate can be run on failed tests either by setting the `tmate-debug` input to 'true' or by re-running a job with the "Enable debug logging" checkbox checked.

### Publish Charm Workflow (`canonical/operator-workflows/.github/workflows/publish_charm.yaml@main`)
Publishes the charm and its resources to appropriate channel, as defined [here](https://github.com/canonical/charming-actions/tree/main/channel).

This workflow requires a `CHARMHUB_TOKEN` secret containing a charmhub token with package-manage and package-view permissions for the charm and the destination channel. See how to generate it [here](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/remote-env-auth).

By default, the publish workflow will search for an [integration test workflow](#integration-test-workflow-canonicaloperator-workflowsgithubworkflowsintegration_testyamlmain) that was succeeded with the exact matching git tree ID. It will then use the artifacts built in that workflow run (charms and images) as the assets for upload. This default behavior can be overridden by providing the `workflow-run-id` input to the publish workflow. When this input is supplied, the publish workflow will specifically retrieve artifacts from the given workflow run.

See [the workflow file](.github/workflows/publish_charm.yaml) for workflow inputs.

### Promote Charm Workflow (`canonical/operator-workflows/.github/workflows/promote_charm.yaml@main`)
Promotes a charm from the selected origin channel to the selected target channel.

This workflow requires a `CHARMHUB_TOKEN` secret containing a charmhub token with package-manage and package-view permissions for the charm and the origin and destination channels. See how to generate it [here](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/remote-env-auth).

See [the workflow file](.github/workflows/promote_charm.yaml) for workflow inputs.

### Update Charm Libs Workflow (`canonical/operator-workflows/.github/workflows/auto_update_charm_libs.yaml@main`)
Checks if updates to the charm libraries are available and, of necessary,  opens a pull request to update them.

This workflow requires `pull_request` and `content` write permissions and a `CHARMHUB_TOKEN` secret containing a charmhub token. See how to generate it [here](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/remote-env-auth).

### Bot PR Approval Workflow (`canonical/operator-workflows/.github/workflows/bot_pr_approval.yaml@main`)
Automatically provides 1 approval for PRs generated by bots.
