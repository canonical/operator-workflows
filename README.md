# operator-workflows

## Description

This repository includes several parametrized CI workflows to be used for both kubernetes and machine charms.

## Usage

To use the workflows in your repository, just reuse them including the `secrets: inherit` key. Examples of usage for every workflow can be found at the [indico operator](https://github.com/canonical/indico-operator/blob/main/.github/workflows). Note that you will need a CHARMHUB_TOKEN among your repository secrets to be able to run the workflows that interact with charmhub.

The following workflows are available:

* test: executes the default tox targets defined in the `tox.ini` file and generates a plain text report. This requires the `lint`, `unit`, `static` and `coverage-report` `tox` environments to be included in the tox defaults. The following parameters are available for this workflow:

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------|-------------------|
| charm-directory | string | Null | The working directory for the charm under working-directory. docs directory, if existing, should be under this directory |
| pre-run-script | string | "" | Path to the bash script to be run before the integration tests |
| self-hosted-runner | bool | true | Whether self-hosted-runner should be enabled |
| self-hosted-runner-label| string | large | Label used to select the self-hosted runner if enabled |
| working-directory | string | "./" | Directory where jobs should be executed |

* comment: Posts the content of the artifact specified as a comment in a PR. It needs to be triggered from a PR triggered workflow.

* integration_test: Builds the existing Dockerfiles, if any, and executes the `integration` test target defined in the `tox.ini` file. The tox environment used can be changed with the `test-tox-env` input. The following parameters are available for this workflow:

The following secrets are available for this workflow:

| Name | Description |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| INTEGRATION_TEST_ARGS | Additional arguments to pass to the integration test execution that contain secrets |

When running the integration tests, the following posargs will be automatically passed to the `integration` target:

* --charm-file [charm_file_name]: The name of the charm artifact generated prior to the integration tests run
* --series [series]: As defined in the `series` configuration described option above
* -k [module]: As defined in the `modules` configuration option described above
* --keep-models
* --model testing: Only for tests running on a microk8s substrate
* One parameter per resource defined in the `metadata.yaml` of the charm, containing a reference to the built image

For instance, for pytest you can leverage this by adding a conftest.py file

```python
def pytest_addoption(parser):
    """Add test arguments."""
    parser.addoption("--charm-file", action="store")
```

and then use the argument value

```python
charm = pytestconfig.getoption("--charm-file")
```

tmate can be run on failed tests either by setting the `tmate-debug` input to 'true' or by re-running a job with the "Enable debug logging" checkbox checked.

* publish_charm: Publishes the charm and its resources to appropriate channel, as defined [here](https://github.com/canonical/charming-actions/tree/main/channel).

This workflow requires a `CHARMHUB_TOKEN` secret containing a charmhub token with package-manage and package-view permissions for the charm and the destination channel. See how to generate it [here](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/remote-env-auth) and a `REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret containg a classic PAT with full repository permissions. See how to generate it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).

The following parameters are available for this workflow:

| charm-directory   | string | Null          | The working directory for the charm under working-directory. docs directory, if existing, should be under this directory |
| charmcraft-channel        | string | latest/stable | Charmcraft channel to use for publishing the charm and resources                                              |
| paas-app-charmer-oci-name | string | Null          | Name of the resource oci image for paas-app-charmer generated apps                               |

The runner image will be set to the value of `bases[0].build-on[0]` in the `charmcraft.yaml` file, defaulting to ubuntu-22.04 if the file does not exist.

* promote_charm: Promotes a charm from the selected origin channel to the selected target channel.

This workflow requires a `CHARMHUB_TOKEN` secret containing a charmhub token with package-manage and package-view permissions for the charm and the origin and destination channels. See how to generate it [here](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/remote-env-auth).

The following parameters are available for this workflow:

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------|-------------------|
| base-architecture | string | amd64 | Charm architecture |
| charm-directory | string | Null | The working directory the charm under working-directory. docs directory, if existing, should be under this directory |

| working-directory | string | "./" | The working directory for the job |

The runner image will be set to the value of `bases[0].build-on[0]` in the `charmcraft.yaml` file, defaulting to ubuntu-22.04 if the file does not exist.

* auto_update_charm_libs: Checks if updates to the charm libraries are available and, of necessary,  opens a pull request to update them.

This workflow requires `pull_request` and `content` write permissions and a `CHARMHUB_TOKEN` secret containing a charmhub token. See how to generate it [here](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/remote-env-auth).

bot_pr_approval: Automatically provides 1 approval for PRs generated by bots.
