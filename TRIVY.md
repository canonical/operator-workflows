# Trivy

According to the [official documentation](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.36/), Trivy is a comprehensive and versatile security scanner. Trivy has scanners that look for security issues, and targets where it can find those issues.

## Description

By enabling Trivy in the integration test, the [Trivy GitHub action](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action) will run a scan in the repository (fs type) or a Docker image (image type) to find vulnerabilities.

The result will be available in the integration test output.

## Warning

- Environment variables have preference over configuration set by ``trivy-fs-config`` or ``trivy-image-config`` parameters.

## How to use

If there is no need for customization, the test can be enabled by setting the parameter ``trivy-fs-enabled`` to true.

For fs, the ``trivy-fs-ref`` has ``"."`` as default value.

Default configuration: will fail with exit code 1 for high and critical vulnerabilities.

Custom configurations can be set in a ``trivy.yaml`` file stored in the repository for both types of testing. The location should be set in ``trivy-fs-config`` and/or ``trivy-image-config``parameters.

## Examples

### Default

```yaml
jobs:
  integration-tests:
    uses: canonical/operator-workflows/.github/workflows/integration_test.yaml@main
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      trivy-fs-enabled: true
```

Since trivy-fs-ref is not set, the current directory (repository root) will be used as the target.

### Custom configuration

```yaml
jobs:
  integration-tests:
    uses: canonical/operator-workflows/.github/workflows/integration_test.yaml@main
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      trivy-fs-enabled: true
      trivy-fs-config: tests/trivy/trivy.yaml
```

Example of trivy.yaml content:

```yaml
format: json
exit-code: 1
severity: CRITICAL
```

See the [Config file](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.36/docs/references/customization/config-file/) for the options list.
